# What is PHML?
Police Health Maintenance Limited is the number one HMO provider for the Nigeria Police Force personnel
and their family members.

At the Police HMO, we believe that everyone deserves access to quality and comprehensive healthcare. That is why we have undertaken the mandate under the GIFSHIP plan, to ensure that your everyday family, individual, groups, etc. can access adequate healthcare as at when needed, at a very affordable rate.

We believe that a well-informed enrollee makes better choices as it relates to regular medical check-up, self-medication etc., even if that will mean us paying more bills as a result of increased visits to the hospital by our enrollees.
